// A JavaScript variable is simply a name of storage location. There are two types of variables in JavaScript : local variable and global variable.

// There are some rules while declaring a JavaScript variable (also known as identifiers).

// Name must start with a letter (a to z or A to Z), underscore( _ ), or dollar( $ ) sign.
// After first letter we can use digits (0 to 9), for example value1.
// JavaScript variables are case sensitive, for example x and X are different variables.

// JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

// Automatically
// Using var
// Using let
// Using const
